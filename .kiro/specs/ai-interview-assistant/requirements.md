# Requirements Document: AI-Powered Interview Assistant

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Interview Assistant is a desktop application built with Tauri 2.x, React 19, and TypeScript 5.8 that helps users prepare for technical interviews. The system captures screenshots of interview questions or scenarios displayed on the user's screen, sends them to an AI aggregator platform (OpenRouter) for analysis, and displays AI-generated explanations and feedback to help users understand and practice their responses. The application uses Clerk with Google OAuth for secure user authentication and maintains a privacy-first approach with no persistent screenshot storage.

## Glossary

- **Application**: The AI-Powered Interview Assistant desktop application

- **AI_Response**: The explanation or feedback generated by an AI model through OpenRouter
- **Clerk**: Authentication platform providing Google OAuth integration
- **Google_OAuth**: Google's authentication service for user identity verification via Clerk
- **Tauri_Backend**: The Rust-based backend component of the Tauri application
- **React_Frontend**: The TypeScript/React-based user interface component built with React 19
- **Authentication_Token**: A credential issued by Clerk/Google OAuth to verify user identity
- **Screen_Capture_Service**: The component responsible for capturing screenshots
- **API_Client**: The component that communicates with OpenRouter API
- **TanStack_Router**: Client-side routing library for navigation
- **TanStack_Query**: Data fetching and state management library
- **SQLite_Database**: Local database for session and user data storage via Tauri SQL plugin

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my Google account via Clerk, so that I can securely access the interview assistant features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN a user has a valid Authentication_Token, THE Application SHALL allow access to all features without re-authentication
5. WHEN an Authentication_Token expires, THE Application SHALL automatically refresh the token or prompt the user to re-authenticate
6. WHEN a user logs out, THE Application SHALL clear the stored Authentication_Token from the database and return to the login screen
7. WHEN authentication completes, THE Application SHALL redirect to the dashboard route using TanStack Router

### Requirement 2: Screen Capture Functionality

**User Story:** As a user, I want to capture screenshots of interview questions on my screen, so that I can get AI-powered explanations and feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user requests AI analysis of a screenshot, THE API_Client SHALL send the screenshot to OpenRouter API
3. WHEN sending a request to OpenRouter, THE API_Client SHALL include the screenshot image in the appropriate format
4. WHEN OpenRouter returns a response, THE Application SHALL parse and extract the AI_Response
5. IF the OpenRouter API request fails, THEN THE Application SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry
6. WHEN the API request is in progress, THE Application SHALL display a loading indicator to the user

### Requirement 4: AI Response Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see AI-generated explanations and feedback clearly, so that I can understand interview questions and improve my preparation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI_Response is received, THE React_Frontend SHALL display it in a readable format
2. WHEN displaying an AI_Response, THE Application SHALL show both the original screenshot and the AI analysis together
3. WHEN an AI_Response contains formatted text, THE Application SHALL preserve formatting including paragraphs, lists, and code blocks
4. THE Application SHALL allow users to scroll through long AI_Response content
5. WHEN a user receives an AI_Response, THE Application SHALL provide an option to capture another screenshot

### Requirement 5: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can focus on interview preparation without technical difficulties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE React_Frontend SHALL display a clear navigation structure with authentication status visible
2. WHEN the application is loading data, THE Application SHALL provide visual feedback to prevent user confusion
3. WHEN errors occur, THE Application SHALL display user-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
4. THE Application SHALL maintain responsive performance with UI updates completing within 100ms for user interactions
5. THE React_Frontend SHALL use a clean, professional design appropriate for interview preparation

### Requirement 6: Data Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication credentials and screenshots to be handled securely, so that my privacy is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Tauri_Backend SHALL store Authentication_Token using secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system
2. THE Application SHALL transmit all API requests to OpenRouter over HTTPS
3. THE Application SHALL NOT store screenshots permanently unless explicitly requested by the user
4. WHEN transmitting screenshots to OpenRouter, THE Application SHALL use secure API authentication
5. THE Application SHALL NOT log or expose sensitive authentication credentials in application logs

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue using it even when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF network connectivity is lost, THEN THE Application SHALL display a clear error message and queue requests for retry
2. IF the OpenRouter API is unavailable, THEN THE Application SHALL inform the user and suggest trying again later
